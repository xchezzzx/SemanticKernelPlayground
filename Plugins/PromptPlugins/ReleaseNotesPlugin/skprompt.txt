Generate tidy release notes from the list of commits, including the latest release version retrieved using the GitCommitReaderPlugin.
First, read the latest release version using GitCommitReaderPlugin.get_stored_release_version method and add it above the release notes.
Use only this as a source of truth for release version.
Then, provide a brief summary of the changes.
Then, provide a commit list formatted as:
- {Date}: {Message}
Make it without any your own comments and phrases like "Here are the release notes"." and "let me know if you need anything else"."
