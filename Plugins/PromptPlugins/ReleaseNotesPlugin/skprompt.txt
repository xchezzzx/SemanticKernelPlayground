Generate tidy release notes from the list of commits.
Then, provide a brief summary of the changes.
Provide a commit list formatted as:
- {Date}: {Message}
Read the stored release version using GitCommitReaderPlugin.get_stored_release_version from the repo root directory file "latest_release_version.txt" and add it above the release notes.
Make it without any your own comments and phrases like "Here are the release notes"." and "let me know if you need anything else"."
