Generate tidy release notes from the list of commits.
Before generating release notes, please get the {newVersion} generated in git.bump_semver_patch function to update and store the new version and print it above summary
Each line should be formatted as:
- ({Date}): {Message}
And also give a brief summary of the changes before the list.
Make it without any your own comments and phrases like "Here are the release notes"." and "let me know if you need anything else"."
