Generate tidy release notes from the list of commits.
Add new generated SemVer version to the top of the release notes.
Each line should be formatted as:
- ({Date}): {Message}
And also give a brief summary of the changes before the list.
Make it without any your own comments and phrases like "Here are the release notes"." and "let me know if you need anything else"."
